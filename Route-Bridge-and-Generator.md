# Route Bridge & Generator (Dev Tools)

## Purpose
Dev navigation helper that lists routes and provides quick links.

## Generator Script
A script scans the app folder and generates a list of routes.

Output example:
- src/generated/routes.generated.ts

## Bridge Page
A dev page reads generated routes and displays them.

## Notes
- This is tooling, not core runtime.
- It can become a “dev module” later.
